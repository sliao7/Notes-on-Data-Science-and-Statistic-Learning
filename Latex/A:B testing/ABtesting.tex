\title{Notes on A/B Testing}

\maketitle
This is the notes I took from the A/B testing course on \href{https://classroom.udacity.com/courses/ud257}{Udacity}.
\section{Hypothesis Testing}
\begin{itemize}
\item Study $P$(results due to chance), which is $p$-value
\item Two groups: control group (orange button) and experiment group (pink button)
\item Assumptions: the number of clicks on each group follows a binomial distribution \\
- $p_{cont}$ = probability of clicking in the control group \\
- $p_{exp}$ = probability of clicking in the experimental group 
\item Null hypothesis ($H_0$): $p_{cont} - p_{exp} = 0$ \\
- The null hypothesis is what our results would look like if the experiment have no effect.

\item Alternative hypothesis ($H_a$): $p_{cont} - p_{exp} \neq 0$\\
- The alternative hypothesis is what our results would look like if the experiment dose have effect.
\item Estimate $p_{cont}$ and $p_{exp}$ from the data we collected, i.e., measure $\hat{p}_{cont}$ and $\hat{p}_{exp}$.
\item Calculate $p$-value = $P(\hat{p}_{cont} - \hat{p}_{exp} | H_0 )$
\item Reject $H_0$ is $p$-value is small enough, i.e. $p$-value < $\alpha$.
\end{itemize}

\section{Metrics}
\subsection{High-level concepts for metrics}
\begin{itemize}
\item \textbf{Business objective:} 
helping students get jobs; financial sustainability \\
Funnel: Homepage visits $\rightarrow$ Exploring the site $\rightarrow$  create account $\rightarrow$ register courses $\rightarrow$ pay for the courses $\rightarrow$ complete courses $\rightarrow$ purchase more related courses $\rightarrow$complete more related courses $\rightarrow$ find a job
\item 
\end{itemize}
